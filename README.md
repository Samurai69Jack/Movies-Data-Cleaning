This project demonstrates data cleaning in Python (pandas) using a movie dataset. Covers handling missing values, regex-based cleaning, duplicates, and feature extraction




## 📂 Project Structure
- `movies_raw.csv` → original dataset  
- `movies_clean.csv` → cleaned dataset  
- `data_cleaning.ipynb` → notebook with all cleaning steps  

## 🛠️ Key Steps
- Cleaning inconsistent year formats with regex
- Splitting and cleaning genres
- Handling missing values in ratings, votes, director, and stars
- Removing duplicates
- Exporting clean dataset

## 📊 Future Work
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizations of genre distribution, ratings, etc.
